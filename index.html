          <p>
            Norway, country of northern Europe that occupies the western half of
            the Scandinavian peninsula. Nearly half of the inhabitants of the
            country live in the far south, in the region around Oslo, the
            capital. About two-thirds of Norway is mountainous, and off its
            much-indented coastline lie, carved by deep glacial fjords, some
            50,000 islands.

            <h4>Oslo</h4>
            <p>
              The capital city of Norway was established in the eleventh century
              by Emperor Harald Hardråde. In ancient times, the city was burned
              down several times, and each time it emerged more robust than
              before. Oslo is considered a global city and the major Norwegian
              hub for trading, shipping and banking.
            </p>
            <h4>Location</h4>
            <p>
              Oslo is positioned at the northernmost end of the Oslofjord and
              occupies around 40 big & small islands within its limits. The
              climate of the region is temperate and humid. Due to the pleasant
              weather, tourists visit Oslo throughout the year.
            </p>
            <h4>Sauna life by the Oslo Fjord</h4>
            <p>
              The joys of sauna life, a tradition hailing from our neighbours in
              Finland, include relaxation, cleansing of the body and a great
              social atmosphere. A sauna session in Oslo may also be combined
              with cultural events and fjord sightseeing. Oslo’s fjordside
              saunas are located along the harbour promenade, right in the heart
              of the city centre. They each have their special features – get
              your swim gear out and pick your favourite.
            </p>
            <h4>Attractions</h4>
            <p>
              Oslo is the seat of the Norwegian government and is also an
              industrial and banking focal point. Its history states that it was
              established by King Harald Hardråde in the early eleventh century,
              and since then, the city has been destroyed and reconstructed
              several times. Oslo offers countless tourist attractions, from
              medieval architecture and museums to modern-day amusements. The
              city has a beautiful coastline that is home to several scenic
              beaches, while the abundant natural recourses have led to the
              establishment of many parks and trails. Oslo has the most exciting
              places of interest that add to the allure of Oslo and are popular
              among visitors.

            <h4>Bergen</h4>
            <p>
              Bergen, city and port, southwestern Norway. The principal port and
              business section is on a peninsula projecting into By Fjord,
              bounded to the north by the inlet and harbour of Vågen (for small
              ships) and on the south by Pudde Bay (for larger vessels) and the
              Store Lungegårds Lake. Originally called Bjørgvin, the city was
              founded in 1070 by King Olaf III Haraldsson.
            </p>
            <h4>Location</h4>
            <p>
              Bergen is located between Hardangerfjord in the South and the
              Sognefjord in the nord - right in the heart of the Fjord Norway
              area. With seven mountains surrounding the city and Norway’s two
              largest fjords – the Sognefjord and the Hardangerfjord not far
              away, Bergen is the perfect place to start if you want to explore
              the fjords of Norway. Seeing the tall mountains with snow-covered
              peaks reflected in the calm water of the fjord is an experience
              unlike any other.
            </p>
            <h4>Tour suggestions in winter</h4>
            <p>
              Seeing the famous fjords is a must for most foreign visitors all
              year. On a day trip to Bergen you can visit the Nærøyfjorden -
              inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List and voted the world’s
              most unspoiled tourist destination by National Geographic. If time
              is limited, the tour Fjord cruise Bergen - Mostraumen is a great
              option. The trip takes 3 hours and starts at Zachariasbryggen,
              right next to the Fish Market and runs every day the whole year.
            </p>
            <h4>Attractions</h4>
            <p>
              In Bergen you can visit popular attractions like Bryggen,
              Fløibanen Funicular, Bergen Aqaurium or the famous Fish Market.
              Bryggen is one of the biggest attractions in Bergen. Bryggen is
              included on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage and is an important
              part of the city. To stroll through Bryggen’s narrow alleyways and
              overhanging galleries is to step back into the mists of time and a
              bygone era.

            <p>
              Trondheim, historic port, central Norway. It lies on a sheltered

              Fjord at the mouth of the Nidelva (river), 23 miles (37 km)
              southeast of the Norwegian Sea. It was founded in 997 by King Olaf
              I Tryggvason as the village of Kaupangr; he built a church and a
              royal residence, Kongsgård, there. The city gained importance as a
              pilgrimage centre, spurred by the legend of the miraculous
              preservation of the body of King Olaf II Haraldsson (later St.
              Olaf), who had been buried there after his death in battle at
              nearby Stiklestad (1030).

              Trondheim has it all. Situated on a fjord, Trondheim offers a
              vibrant city experience along with stunning natural surroundings.
              In winter, you can hunt for the dancing lights of the Aurora
              Borealis or go skiing at local winter parks like Vassfjellet
              Vinterpark. In summer, you can venture just beyond the city’s
              edges in Bymarka. This scenic area is ideal for hiking, mountain
              biking or cross-country skiing in the winter months, with an array
              of marked trails criss-crossing the reserve, leading to
              spectacular viewpoints, charming rest areas and cosy cabins
              offering food and refreshments. And if you want to venture out
              onto the fjord, take a boat trip to the islands if Hitra to taste
              some of the world’s best seafood.

              Trondheim was once the Viking capital of Norway? <br />But even
              before the Pilgrims and the Viking Age, people were drawn to the
              region because of the seafood-rich fjords and vast mountains
              filled with wildlife and some of the most fertile soil in the
              country.
